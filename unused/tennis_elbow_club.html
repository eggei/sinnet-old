								<b>Tennis Elbow Club</b> is the new 4 song EP from the Boston project Sinnet. This collection of songs is our most personal, textured and nuanced to date. It celebrates a love of songwriters like Paul Simon and Elliott Smith with the rhythm and swagger of bands like Booker T & The MGs and Spoon. It blends elements of soul, surf, synth-pop and spookiness with smart indie-rock and pop.</p>
							<p>Thematically, the songs continue the emotional and personal catharsis of the project and center around themes of family, memory and keeping the memory of my mother alive.
							</p>
							<p>	
								This marks our first time recording with “Gentleman genius of sound” Mr. Elio DeLuca at Soul Shop in Medford, MA. Elio has worked with countless Boston bands as well as renown acts like Titus Andronicus, Wilder Maker, Peter Matthew Bauer and many more. He brought a seriously deep knowledge of music, recording and silly 90’s hip hop references to our jams.

									<b>Lil’ Flicker</b> <br>
									is about the beautifully strange way memories work. It’s about those little momentary gaps when you forget a person, pet or thing is gone. Bittersweet flashes. I used to get these urges to call my Mom on the phone and just for a second I’d forget that I couldn’t. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Tenez!</b><br>
									My mom used to send me and my brother to tennis lessons during the summer to keep us occupied. I mostly loved it. She also used to record tennis matches on numerous VHS tapes around the house. I’d later record MTV and other things over them.So every once in a while, between MTV Beach House clips you’d get a little John McEnroe or Ivan Lendl. The song title “Tenez!” comes from the French term that helped give name to the sport known as tennis. Also, given our band’s name, it seemed like we should have a song about tennis.								</p>

									<b>The Living Room Projector</b> <br>
									is full of little flickers of my childhood memories. My Dad really did race cars on ice (and still does). My brother actually has a trophy from the day he was born. It was the same day as one of my Dad’s races, so the organizers gave him a trophy as a friendly gesture. 
								</p>
								<p>	
									<b>World's Fair</b><br>
									looks to the present state of the world and the future. I’m a new Dad. The the idea of bringing kids into this world is daunting at times. Especially today’s when the political environment is so downright scary. It’s easy to want to see it all as some surreal carnival that won’t affect us, unfortunately, that’s just not the case.
