  body: [
    `<i>Iron Woman</i> has long been a favorite cover of ours. Originally by Devin Davis, who's sole album "Lonely People of the World Unite" is a criminally underrated power-pop gem. It's been a staple of our live shows for years.`,
    `A bunch of years ago we realized that we were all in the same Devin Davis appreciation facebook group so, covering one of his songs was an easy move.`,
    `The recent downtime in live music has been a good opportunity to record our own version of it and use the proceeds to support a cause we believe in (women's reproductive rights). All proceeds go to <b>Planned Parenthood</b>.`,
    `The track features a bunch of talented buds: <b>Joel Reader</b> (The Fatal Flaw, MTX, Pansy Division), <b>Jac Mestrel</b> (Little Happy Clouds), <b>John Drislane</b> (The Daisies, The Maxims), <b>Elio DeLuca</b> (Titus Andronicus) and more!`,
    `Did I mention there is a <b>sax solo?</b> Hell yeah!`,
