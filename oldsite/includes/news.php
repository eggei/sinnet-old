		<h2>Recording in Nashua</h2>
		<p>
		This weekend we took a lil' trip up to Nashua, NH to record some new jams, mini-blizzard and the intense humming of my car's broken muffler be damned! <br>
		We worked again with our good friend <b>Matt Girard</b> in an old Mill building studio recently dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bopnique">Bopnique 3.0.</a> It's a nice sized space, covered in wood with an abundance of awesome vintage synths. The tracks will most likely be part of a full length in the coming year. Stay tuned!

		Things have been pleasantly busy in Sinnet-land. We were choosen by the lovely folks at <b>Converse</b> to participate in their <b>Rubber Tracks</b> program. Basically, we got to spend a day recording at Q Division and picked up some sweet kicks. There was plenty of nerding-out over their selection of gear and "drum porn". Needless to say we had a splendid time.

		We are tickled pink  to announce the release of our new single Year of the Whale! 
	</p>	
		'Year of the Whale' marks a step out of the bedroom recordings that are Sinnet's 'Midwest Manners' debut EP and into a proper studio. The cut recorded with local renaissance man Matthew A. Girard (Parks, Motion Stick, Neutral Uke Hotel) is no longer a solo affair featuring; John Drislane on drums and Marlo Pedroso on guitar.<br>
		Thematically, 'Whale' comes from a trying year when singer/songwriter Aaron Spransy's mother suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. Difficult times, coated in Melville-ian themes, and a few years allowed 'Whale' to rise to the surface. Enjoy!

		The unmistakable chill and color of Fall is in the air and us gents of Sinnet are busy stirring up a delicious sonic stew to warm you up! 
	</p>	 
	<p>
		First, on Saturday Rocktober 13th Sinnet will be joined by two killer bands at PA's Lounge:  <a href="http://www.falconarrow.bandcamp.com">Falcon Arrow</a> , the bass and drum duo from Minneapolis, are back armed with crazy psych loops mashed with intercepted radio broadcast madness. Way BIG. As if that's not enough, we've finally lined up a show with the genre defying <a href="http://www.jslashq.bandcamp.com">J/Q</a>, another dynamic duo (bass/vocals, drum/synth) of spazz pop deliciousness. EPIC.
	</p>	
	<p>	
	 	<img class="hello_poster" src="img/posters/tallahassee.jpg" alt="tallahassee" width="" height="" />
		For <b>Halloween</b> we decided to honor the lovely Minneapolis boys: <b>The Replacements</b> not once but twice. We'll be performing a selection of their best non-hits and conjuring up their infamous live performances at <b>The Midway Cafe in JP on Friday, October 26th</b> with Tallahassee.
		Then again on <b>Saturday, October 27th</b> at <b>What We Talk About in Allston</b> with&#151;get this!&#151;Guided By Voices! How awesome is that? Okay, so it's not the real GBV, but you probably won't even notice. We go on super early, at 7:00pm, so you can trick or treat, watch us play, and still shake it up at that costume ball afterwards! What can we say, we aim to please.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other news, we've continued work on recording under the deft hands of <a href="http://matthewgirard.com/">Matt Girard</a>..  You should hear the fat tone on the drums! We hope to have a new single out for you before winter hits, when (not to get too far ahead of ourselves) we will make our <b>debut at Great Scott.</b> We're gonna spank the tight jeans off the hip kid at the Pill.
